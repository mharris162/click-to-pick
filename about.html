	<h3> Our Story</h3>
	<p> Throughout my life, I have known many people who have analysis paralysis and have a hard time choosing where to eat. I saw a need for a tool that would help people choose where to eat based on several preferences. So Click to Pick was born. We have gladly helped our neurodivergent friends  choose where to eat since 2024. </p>
